# Mini-Project

> A simple, lightweight web demo built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — ideal for showcasing UI/UX or small client-side interactions.

## 🔎 What is this

This “Mini-Project” is a small, standalone web application (or demo) that demonstrates basic front-end skills using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s useful as a quick prototype, learning exercise, or a starting point for a larger web project.

---

## 🧩 What’s inside / Features

- A simple UI (with `trial.html`, `style.css`) — a basic front-end structure.  
- `main.js` — contains client-side logic (for form handling, DOM updates, or any custom JS logic).  
- Clean, minimal dependencies: no frameworks — pure web technologies for portability.  
- Easy to extend: you can build on top of this base to add backend, frameworks, or more complex functionality.

## 🚀 How to run / Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Sureka/Mini-Project.git
   cd Mini-Project

2. Open the HTML file in your browser:

Double-click `trial.html`

Or run a local HTTP server (recommended if you use JS modules or extra assets). For example, using Python:
### if you have Python 3 installed
```bash
cd Mini-Project
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/trial.html in your browser
```

3. Explore the UI / functionality.

That’s it — no build tools, no dependencies needed.
